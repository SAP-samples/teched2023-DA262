# Register for a Trial SAP BTP Account
If you wish to continue the exercises outside of SAP TechEd and do already have an SAP BTP account to use, you can register for a trial account at https://www.sap.com/cmp/td/sap-hana-cloud-trial.html.  A [free tier](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html) account can also be used but it does require providing a credit card number.  A benefit of using free tier is that the account can be upgraded to a paid service plan without having to re-create the account.

After registering for a trial account using the link above, open your SAP BTP Cockpit and get started by creating a SAP HANA Cloud instances.

1. Open the [welcome page](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/trial/#/home/trial) and go to your trial account.

6.	Click the button **Create** in the top right and select SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database to invoke the Create Instance wizard.

7.  Choose **SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database** and click the button **Next Step**.

8.  Use default values for the remainder of the wizard, with the following exceptions:
    * In Step 2 (General), enter **DEMO_HANA_DB** for the instance name. Enter and confirm your administrator password â€“ ***PLEASE REMEMBER IT AND/OR WRITE IT DOWN!***
    * In Step 6 (Data Lake), turn on the toggle switch to Create Data Lake. Enter **DEMO_HANA_HDL** for the instance name.

9.	Complete the wizard.

    The SAP HANA Cloud instances DEMO_HANA_DB and DEMO_HANA_HDL will be created, and this process may take  approx. 10 minutes.  The frequency of updates to the page can be set using the auto-refresh feature in the top right.  Once the instances are created, their status will change to RUNNING.

Feel free to move to the next exercise on the SAP BTP while waiting for the SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database instance to switch to a running status.
