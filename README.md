# Session DA262 - SAP HANA Cloud from an adminstrators perspective

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session called DA262 - SAP HANA Cloud from an adminstrators perspective.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to the end-to-end picture of operations required for running the SAP HANA Cloud database, using the Web-based tools SAP HANA Cloud Central and SAP HANA database explorer. 

## Requirements

To complete this workshop, you need access to an SAP BTP account. You can access SAP HANA Cloud from within SAP BTP and you can use a trial, free tier,  or productive version of SAP HANA Cloud.  **This workshop assumes that you already have a SAP BTP account and a SAP HANA Cloud database.**  If not, you can register for free at https://www.sap.com/cmp/td/sap-hana-cloud-trial.html.  The exercises make use of a **trial account**, but a [free tier](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html) account can also be used.  A benefit of using free tier is that the account can be upgraded to a paid service plan without having to re-create the account.
