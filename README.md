# Session DA262 - SAP HANA Cloud from an administrator's perspective

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session called DA262 - SAP HANA Cloud from an administrator's perspective.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to the end-to-end picture of operations required for running the SAP HANA Cloud database, using the Web-based tools SAP HANA Cloud Central and SAP HANA database explorer. 

## Requirements

To complete this workshop, you need access to an SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) account. You can access SAP HANA Cloud from within SAP BTP and you can use a trial, free tier,  or productive version of SAP HANA Cloud.  **This workshop assumes that you already have a SAP BTP account and an SAP HANA Cloud database.**  If not, you can register for free at https://www.sap.com/cmp/td/sap-hana-cloud-trial.html.  The exercises make use of a **trial account**, but a [free tier](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html) account can also be used.  A benefit of using free tier is that the account can be upgraded to a paid service plan without having to re-create the account but may take longer to signup.

After registering for a trial account using the link above, open your SAP BTP Cockpit and get started by creating a SAP HANA Cloud instances.

1. Open the [welcome page](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/trial/#/home/trial) and go to your trial account.

    * In Step 6 (Data Lake), turn on the toggle switch to Create Data Lake. Enter **DEMO_HANA_HDL** for the instance name.

9.	Complete the wizard.

    The SAP HANA Cloud instances DEMO_HANA_DB and DEMO_HANA_HDL will be created, and this process may take  approx. 10 minutes.  The frequency of updates to the page can be set using the auto-refresh feature in the top right.  Once the instances are created, their status will change to RUNNING.
